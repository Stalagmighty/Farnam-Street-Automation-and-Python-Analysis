Text Analysis with Google Sheets and Python

This repository contains a Python script developed as part of my learning journey to explore how to integrate Google Sheets, text analysis, and AI-driven insights. The script is a combination of experiments with Google APIs, text cleaning, word frequency analysis, and OpenAI's GPT for summarising results.

Please note: This script is not a polished, production-ready solution but a learning exercise. Feedback and suggestions are welcome to help improve the code and my understanding.

Features
Google Sheets Integration:

Connects to a Google Sheet using the Google Sheets API.
Reads and processes data from a specified range.
Text Cleaning:

Removes unnecessary characters, whitespace, and Unicode artifacts to ensure the data is clean for analysis.
Word Frequency Analysis:

Counts the frequency of words in the text, excluding common stop words.
Displays the top 20 most common words in the dataset.
Data Visualization:

Generates a bar chart to visualize word frequency using Matplotlib.
AI-Powered Insights:

Uses OpenAI's GPT to provide a natural language summary or interpretation of the most frequent words.
How It Works
Authentication with Google Sheets:

Requires a Google Cloud service account and JSON credentials.
Reads data from a specified sheet and range.
Text Analysis:

Processes content to count word frequencies while excluding common stop words.
Outputs the results as a DataFrame and a bar chart.
AI-Generated Insights:

Prepares a prompt based on the most common words and uses OpenAI GPT to provide a human-readable summary.
Requirements
Python 3.7 or higher
Libraries:
google-auth and google-auth-oauthlib for authentication.
google-api-python-client for accessing Google Sheets.
pandas for data manipulation.
matplotlib for visualizations.
openai for AI integration.
re for text processing.
Setup
Google Sheets API:

Set up a Google Cloud project and enable the Google Sheets API.
Create a service account and download the JSON credentials file.
Share the Google Sheet with the service account email.
Python Environment:

Install the required libraries:
bash
Copy code
pip install google-api-python-client pandas matplotlib openai
Run the Script:

Replace the placeholders in the script:
SERVICE_ACCOUNT_FILE: Path to your JSON credentials.
SPREADSHEET_ID: ID of your Google Sheet.
RANGE_NAME: Range of data to process (e.g., Sheet1!A1:B200).
Run the script in your Python environment.
